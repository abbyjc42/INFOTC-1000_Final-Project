## Hobbies and Interests

In my freetime, I enjoy teaching myself guitar and experimenting with a variety of different art mediums. I've been drawing my whole life, and have experience with colored pencils, watercolors, acrylics, markers, sculpture, and an assorted mix of crafting. Besides researching tips and references online, I am completely self-taught.

You can see some examples of things I've done [here](Gallery.md).

As far as interests go, I am a big fan of science fiction. I really enjoy older films like the original Star Wars trilogy, but also the Matrix films and standalones like Ex Machina, Snowpiercer, Chappie, District 9, Moon, and so on. Thanks to my father I've developed a taste for B-movies as well as films that strange or different from anything I've seen before, so I watch quite a few independent and foreign movies outside of the mainstream.

I also like videogames, though I do not play them much at this point. Story-driven games involving exploration and strategy are my favorite, though I am also a big fan of the Sims franchise. Since I started with the Sims 2 years ago, I've wanted to learn more about what goes into making a realistic (but also quirky and larger-than-life) simulation game that appeals to such a wide variety of players while also creating an open framework that welcomes modders and custom content creators to add their own touch. Sometime soon I hope to take a look into what it takes to create mods, as a way to practice coding within a larger preexisting structure and use some of my artistic skills.
