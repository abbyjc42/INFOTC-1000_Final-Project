## Volunteerwork and Community Involvement

I did a variety of activities around my community over the years while I lived in the Mountain View area, including things through a homeschooling group, Girlscouts, and Nature Nuts. However, I had the most involvement with the local public library and theater.

**The Local Library:**

Up until I moved, I volunteered quite a bit at the library where my mother worked. For several years I helped with summer reading, back-to-school fairs, reading at daycares, and many other things calling for hands-on assistance. I also did a number of art projects related to library events, including designs for bookmarks, posters, and coloring pages for children.

While I mostly assisted the library staff, I got the chance to teach two different classes for younger kids. One was a crafting class using simple household materials like cereal boxes to make little box sculpture of characters, and the other was an introduction to coding for beginners aged 6-12 years old. At the time of the coding class I didn't yet have any in-depth experience with coding, but I showed the kids how they could make simple interactive games with Scratch and Quest.

**Theater:**

I was a member of a local theater guild for about the last two and half years before I moved. While I only performed once, I attended meetings and helped a lot behind the scenes - handing out flyers, contributing to sets and costumes, lending things for use as props, and so on.
The physical theater where the guild performed suffered a fire and much of its costume and prop collection was irreparably damaged. Had I stayed in the area longer I think I would have volunteered to help build, craft, and collect new things to help the guild recover, but I moved before repairs on the theater were fully complete.
