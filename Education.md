## Education

My education has been a little different than the average experience. I was homeschooled from the age of five, right up until the end of highschool. Where I grew up homeschooling was a somewhat common thing. Many parents chose to homeschool their children for religious reasons (not a reason for my own family's decision), because they lived so far outside of town, or simply because they thought they could do a better job than the local school system.

Even though I was homeschooled, I was taught from most of the same textbooks as my peers who were in public school, and as I got older online tests and study tools were incorporated into my curriculum to make sure I was where I needed to be.

During my last two years of highschool, I started taking online dual-credit courses through Missouri State University West Plains to get a head start in earning a few college credits, before finally transferring to the University of Missouri. I took a few more online classes through Mizzou, and this past summer took part in a month-long Engineering Success Bridge Program. About forty of us attended the program, which was my first real experience being a learning environment with others.

This program included chemistry and math preparation, as well as a condensed public speaking class specifcally structured for engineering majors. While it was a challenging adjustment, it helped me ease into the campus environment, meet other like-minded students in various majors, and secure my confidence in pursuing Information Technology as a major.

At the time of writing this I am finishing up the Fall 2019 semester at Mizzou.
