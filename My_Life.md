## My Life

**Early Life:**

I was born in Minnesota, where I lived until I was five. At that age, my parents decided to move to Missouri, in a semi-rural area situated between the small towns of Mountain View and Willow Springs. We lived there for 10 years, and experimented with many things during that time (raising livestock, building our own house, gardening, etc.).

I believe I had a rather unique upbringing because even though my parents were trying out a homesteading lifestyle, my dad worked from home the whole time as a developer for a company that provides software to healthcare agencies. Being an only child and homeschooled, I learned to be independent and take responsibility for my learning from an early age.

I've always loved to learn about subjects that interest me, and outside of schoolwork I spent a lot of time teaching myself to draw and animate, as well as reading educational books and online material.

**Now:**

About two years ago, my family made another major move. Now we live in Columbia, close to the University of Missouri but in a neighborhood set apart from the busier part of the city. Being homeschooled throughout my highscool years made the transition easier, since I didn't have many deep connections to sever and was able to keep up with work while we fixed up our new place.

I really like living in Columbia - there's a variety of things to do and it's well-suited to the lifestyle my family leads right now. There is a range of [restaurants][Taste Place] and [businesses][Papa's] that cater to different peoples' interests, plus nature trails and parks like the MKT, Shelter Gardens, or Stevens Lake that allow you to get fresh air without having to go far.
